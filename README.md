## What is this?

The purpose of this challenge is to pick an application from the App Store and **recreate some views**.
In my case I wanted to try to focus on the design of the **Volotea** app.
I tried to recreate the start page and the ticket list.
The design was created with **Sketch** and then rewritten in **SwiftUI**.
